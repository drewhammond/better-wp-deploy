better-wp-deploy
================

A more efficient way to develop and maintain WordPress stacks across multiple environments. This boilerplate project
is designed with an agile development approach.

## Background

We believe changes to your WordPress theme or plugin should be:

* Frequent
* Encouraged
* Easy to perform
* Easy to rollback
* Isolated to only what has been modified

The goal of this project is to make the process of developing, maintaining, and deploying new versions of your
theme or plugin as painless and error-free as possible. The build and deployment process should be simple and easy to
configure. _The more moving parts you have, the harder it is to fix when something goes wrong._

We believe you should be able to push a single line fix to your code without having to redeploy an entire WordPress 
instance with plugin files that were never touched. As such, this project encourages lightweight pushes and rollbacks.
